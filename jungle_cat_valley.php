// The Solar Solution

//1. Include the necessary files
require_once('Solar.php');

//2. Instantiate the Solar class
$solar = new Solar();

//3. Get the current weather data for the user's location
$weather = $solar->getWeatherForLocation();

//4. Check the weather conditions and set the appropriate variables
$sun_hours = $weather['sunHours'];
$sun_intensity = $weather['sunIntensity'];
$wind_speed = $weather['windSpeed'];

//5. Calculate the solar energy production potential
$solar_output = $solar->calculateSolarOutput($sun_hours, $sun_intensity);

//6. Determine the optimal system size for the user
$system_size = $solar->determineSystemSize($solar_output);

//7. Determine the estimated cost of the system
$cost = $solar->calculateCost($system_size);

//8. Estimate the cost savings over the lifetime of the system
$savings = $solar->calculateSavings($system_size, $cost, $wind_speed);

//9. Recommend the optimal system and provide a detailed report
$solar->recommendSystem($system_size, $cost, $savings);

//10. Add the data to the database for tracking
$solar->addToDatabase($system_size, $cost, $savings);

//11. Generate an invoice for the customer
$solar->generateInvoice();

//12. Send an email to the customer
$solar->sendEmail();

//13. Set up monitoring of the system
$solar->setupMonitoring();

//14. Set up scheduled maintenance
$solar->setupMaintenance();

//15. Train customer on how to use the system
$solar->trainCustomer();

//16. Set up customer service
$solar->setupCustomerService();

//17. Monitor system performance
$solar->monitorPerformance();

//18. Offer additional services to customer
$solar->offerServices();

//19. Educate customer on how to best use the system
$solar->educateCustomer();

//20. Follow up with customer to ensure satisfaction
$solar->followUp();
